When Working on the Project

How to Switch to the Test Branch?

git checkout test-branch

How to Pull the Latest Changes?
To ensure you have the most up-to-date version of the project before starting your work:

git pull origin test-branch

Install Dependencies (If Needed)?
After pulling changes, check if any new dependencies were added. Run the following command to install them:

npm install

This will download all necessary dependencies based on the package.json file. The node_modules folder will not be included in the repository, so you must install these dependencies locally after pulling.

Add and Commit Your Changes?
After completing your work, add your changes to be tracked and commit them with a meaningful message:

git add .
git commit -m "Brief description of changes"

Push Your Changes to the Test Branch?
Once committed, push your changes to the test-branch:

git push origin test-branch

Step 7: Create a Pull Request (If Ready for Main Branch)
If your changes are tested and working correctly, go to GitHub, create a pull request, and request to merge test-branch into main.
