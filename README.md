Learn2Code - Quiz Application

Learn2Code is a web-based quiz application designed to help users learn programming concepts interactively. It features a database-driven backend that stores lessons and quizzes for different programming languages, with a frontend that dynamically fetches and displays quiz questions. The project uses Node.js and MySQL for managing data and JavaScript for handling user interactions.

To contribute, always work on the test-branch, pull the latest changes before making edits, and push your updates after committing. Dependencies are managed via npm install, and node_modules should be excluded from the repository using .gitignore. If you need database modifications, contact the project lead.
